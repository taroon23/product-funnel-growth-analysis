EXPERIMENT: Desktop Checkout Redesign
PRIORITY: P0 - Critical Business Impact

HYPOTHESIS:
-----------
Simplifying Desktop checkout flow (following Mobile UX patterns) will improve
payment completion rate from 5.0% to 10.0%.

CURRENT STATE:
--------------
• Desktop Payment → Confirmation: 5.0%
• Mobile Payment → Confirmation: 10.0%
• Gap: 2.0x difference

PROPOSED CHANGES (Control vs. Treatment):
------------------------------------------
Control (Current):
  ✗ Multi-page checkout (3-4 pages)
  ✗ Manual form entry for all fields
  ✗ Limited payment methods (credit card only)
  
Treatment (New):
  ✓ Single-page checkout
  ✓ Browser autofill enabled + smart defaults
  ✓ Multiple payment methods (Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal)
  ✓ Progress indicator
  ✓ Guest checkout option

SUCCESS METRICS:
----------------
Primary: Payment → Confirmation rate
Secondary: 
  • Time to complete checkout
  • Form abandonment rate
  • Error rate on payment page

SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION:
------------------------
• Baseline rate: 4.98%
• Target rate: 9.97% (MDE: 4.98%)
• Required per group: 437 users
• Total required: 874 users
• Current daily Desktop payments: ~25
• Estimated test duration: 35 days (~5 weeks)

REVENUE IMPACT:
---------------
• Current monthly Desktop confirmations: ~37
• If successful (2x improvement): ~75
• Additional monthly revenue: $9K
• Annual impact: $112K+

RISK ASSESSMENT:
----------------
Risk Level: LOW
• Mobile version already validates UX patterns work
• Can easily revert if negative impact
• Engineering effort: ~2 sprint

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
--------------------
Week 1-2: Design + Development
Week 3: QA + Staging tests  
Week 4-9: Run experiment
Week 10: Analysis + Decision

DECISION CRITERIA:
------------------
Ship if: p < 0.05 AND lift > 5.0%
Iterate if: No statistical significance
Kill if: Negative impact on secondary metrics
